            Set an alarm on our site (phone app?) and when the time comes, 
            your cat alarm will start ringing and drive around so that you actually 
            have to get out of bed and find it to turn it off.
            A great start to your day!

            The clock will also keep track (maybe) of how long it takes you to turn
            the alarm off, so don't embarrass yourself. Time is money.
